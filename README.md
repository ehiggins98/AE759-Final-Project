My goal is to implement the algorithm from this paper: [An IMU/UWB/Vision-based Extended Kalman Filter for Mini-UAV Localization in Indoor Environment using 802.15.4a Wireless Sensor Network](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10846-012-9742-1)

This repository is heavily based on the [ArduPilot plugin for Gazebo](https://github.com/khancyr/ardupilot_gazebo/).
